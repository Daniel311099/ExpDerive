# SayTeX
Speak math, get LaTeX!

SayTeX is a tool for converting spoken math into LaTeX equations. 

Read the documentation at [saytex.readthedocs.io](https://saytex.readthedocs.io).

Experience the demo at [demo.saytex.xyz](https://demo.saytex.xyz).

## Overview

SayTeX is distributed as a Python package, enabling users of it to easily convert between transcribed spoken math and LaTeX.

Paired with a speech recognition service, the SayTeX Python package can be used for dictating LaTeX, as shown in the [demo](https://demo.saytex.xyz).

The package is [highly configurable](https://saytex.readthedocs.io/en/latest/advancedusage.html).

## Installation

Install SayTeX using PyPI: `pip install saytex`.

Read more in the [installation documentation](https://saytex.readthedocs.io/en/latest/gettingstarted.html#installation).

## Usage

```python
from saytex import Saytex

saytex_compiler = Saytex()

print(saytex_compiler.to_latex("pi squared over six"))
```

The above minimal example will print `\frac{\pi^2}{6}`. For advanced use, read the [documentation](https://saytex.readthedocs.io).
